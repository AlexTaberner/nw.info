<h2>Terms of Service</h2>
<h4>Definitions</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Artist</strong><br />The artist offering the service, that's me, "Bravo".</li>
<li><strong>Commissioner</strong><br />The person making the request for services, that's you.</li>
<li><strong>Service</strong><br />Any business surrounding the creation, use, inclusion, or modification of artwork created by the artist (a.k.a. me).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Content</h4>
<p>I will attempt to draw, illustrate, or color anything that is not included in the "Will not draw" list; however, if the request is outside of the scope of things I usually draw, then I can not provide a guarantee of the quality of the art. Please review my galleries for examples of content that I typically create. If you are unsure, then please send me a note and ask about the content you are interested in.</p>

</ul>
I will not draw any of the content above under any circumstance and this is non-negotiable. If the content may be questionable in nature or skirt close to the content above, then please ask first.</div>
<div class="alert alert-warning"><strong>Note</strong>: If a specific product or service that is not currently offered (e.g. colored sketches, full body badge, sequence/comic pages, etc.), then it is not something I currently offer at this time or coincides with another service.</div>
<h4>Edits</h4>
<p>Minor edits during the sketch phase of a drawing are allowed, such as minor details and specifics not normally covered in a current character description/reference. Major changes (such as complete pose or attire changes) may be subject to additional charges if the details were previously agreed upon within reason.</p>
<h4>My Rights</h4>
<p>I retain all rights to the artwork, original visual designs, and to my characters, including the rights to use your commission for my own promotion and personal monetization, such as providing examples for other commissioners, selling prints, or in the creation of art books. I agree to never use your commission in a third-party project without your permission.</p>
<h4>Your Rights</h4>
<p>You retain rights to any of your characters or designs that are entirely original and that I did not have a part in creating. I will not use any commissions involving your character for third-party commercial use without your consent. You are welcome to use or alter your image as an icon, banner, or for other personal non-commercial use. You may not use or alter your commission for commercial purposes without my consent and compensation agreed upon.</p>
<h4>Legal Age</h4>
<p>The commissioner must be 18+ for adult themed works.</p>
<h4>Payment</h4>
<p>I accept Square, Paypal and Google Wallet. If a different form of payment is desired, please contact me and ask me so I can attempt to accomidate you. Once I've acknowledged the commission I will send you my information for payment via your preferred method. DO NOT send a payment until I provide a confirmation of your commission and payment information.  Payments received prior to a confirmation of commission will be treated as a donation and not a payment of work. I will not start the image until I've been paid in full.</p>
<h4>Refunds</h4>
<p>You may ask for a refund at any time after payment for any reason. If any work has been done on your commission, a base minimum of 25% will be kept for the time used in preparing/drawing your commission. The final amount kept will be in relation to how complete the image was before it was requested for refund. Please ask if you are curious about the state of your commission before requesting a refund. Any form of refund may not be requested after the work is completed.</p>
<h4>Refusal</h4>
<p>I reserve right to refuse service to anyone at any time for any reason.</p>
